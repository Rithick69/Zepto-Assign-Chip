# Zepto-Assign-Chip
This repository is for the SDE role assignment for Zepto

I have achieved the following tasks for this requirement:

1. When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
2. As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
3. Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
4. Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
5. Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

I have  also implemented the bonus task:

1 .When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted.

2.  I have tried adding typescript to the code, but it still contains type errors, component is working although I will make error corrections for those type errors in the future.

3.  I have tried to break down the code into components keeping the simplicity of the application in mind for better readability.
